                    Hello and welcome to my website! I have had a range of industry experiences and have 
                    achieved a PhD in Mechanical Engineering. If you are looking 
                    for a personal tutor for yourself or your children, I am perfect. 
                    As a friendly father of two, I have experience in explaining 
                    difficult concepts to children and teens. I have recently 
                    refurbished an office space in my home to accommodate 
                    individuals or groups of students for quality in person learning. 
                    I am originally from India but have been living in the UK 
                    for over a decade, so I am fluent in both my native 
                    Hindi and English. I am committed to helping students meet their 
                    goals and can adapt to different learning needs.
